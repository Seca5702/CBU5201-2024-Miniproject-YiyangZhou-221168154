# CBU5201-2024-Miniproject-YiyangZhou-221168154

This project is the miniproject required for my course "CBU5201 - Machine Learning."

My name is Yiyang Zhou, and my QMUL ID is 221168154.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a narrated story is real or fictional based on a 2-5 minute audio recording. The formalized description of this project is shown as follows:

**Audio Classification Challenge**:
   - Processing and analyzing complex audio features
   - Handling variations in speaking styles and emotional expressions
   - Extracting meaningful patterns from high-dimensional acoustic data

**Technical Components**:
   - Audio signal processing and feature extraction
   - Data augmentation for robust model training
   - Ensemble learning with multiple classifiers:
     * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     * Random Forest (RF)
     * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Research Objectives**:
   - Develop an accurate and robust classification system
   - Compare and combine different machine learning approaches
   - Achieve improved performance through ensemble methods

**What's Interesting About the Project**:

- **Data Set Expansion**: Despite the initial small scale of available datasets, innovative strategies are required to expand the data pool, enhancing the model's learning capabilities and generalization.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Impact**: The project intersects multiple disciplines, from machine learning and audio processing to psychology and security, showcasing its broad applicability and potential for real-world impact.
- **Limitation of deep learning**: Small dataset size also implies that deep learning algorithms, which generally perform well but require larger datasets, may not perform as well as classical machine learning algorithms in this project.

The innovative use of ensemble learning methods helps overcome individual model limitations and provides a more reliable solution for deception detection in audio narratives.

By addressing these challenges, the project aims to help people better identify the authenticity of verbal messages, which has important implications in the fields of fraud detection and prevention, psychological analysis and behavioral research, security and forensics applications, and human-computer interaction systems.
